    What does it mean to be a "people person"? Some might say it means being an extrovert who thrives in the presence of others. I say, as an introverted extrovert, that it means finding passion in building authentic connections and collaborating to make a positive difference for others - through problem-solving, innovation, and empathy.
    <br> I am currently a social entrepreneur collaborating with professionals, mentors, and teammates in hopes of addressing a prevalent challenge within the mental health industry. Alongside this entrepreneurial journey, I am also a student at Northwestern University, studying to obtain my MBA (Kellogg School of Management) and MS in Design Innovation (McCormick School of Engineering).
    <br><br>Previously, I worked as a Senior Consultant for Deloitte Consulting in the Human Capital practice, where I collaborated alongside Fortune 500 clients to solve their most pressing people challenges and gained experience leading cross-functional teams to enable successful cultural and digital transformations. I've also had the opportunity to embed my passion for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into my career by contributing to Deloitteâ€™s DEI Consulting Practice, collaborating with executive leaders within Deloitte and across the marketplace to develop provocative and cutting-edge DEI thought leadership aimed to support organizations in moving the needle forward.
